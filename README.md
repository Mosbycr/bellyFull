##Project Description:
**BellyFull** is a website that allows local restaurants to list their leftover items each day for non-profits to claim. Once a non-profit register, they will be redirected to the donations page to claim items. Contact info will be listed for non-profits to be able to communicate with the restaurants and get the items claimed.
