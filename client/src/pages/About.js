                <p> The US is facing a food waste crisis. Up to 40% of all food goes to waste across the country, and restaurants alone throw away 133 billion pounds of food each year. This has a serious impact on small business, food insecurity, and is a major contributing force to climate change.</p>
                <p>We seek a world of hope, tolerance and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and all people live with dignity and security.</p>
