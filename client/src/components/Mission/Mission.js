            At BellyFull our vision is a simple one, help the Richmond
            community. As residents of a food desert we believe it is our
            responsibility to help those who may not have access to fresh food
            daily. By connection restauranteurs with non-profits in the area we
            hope to reduce food waste as well as provide food to those who are
            food insecure.
